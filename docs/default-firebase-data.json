As an attendee, you can look forward to a highly interactive workshop. You won't be left to figure things out on your own. The workshop facilitator will provide simple skeletons, small tasks, and datasets. These practical resources will enable you to write just a few lines of code to complete various exercises and gain a solid understanding of the concepts being taught. It's a great opportunity to learn by doing and build your confidence in data analytics with Kotlin."

Regression testing, while a powerful tool, may not always be the most practical solution in such environments. While this form of testing has traditionally been used to identify defects and issues with software, the process can be slow, expensive, and can impede development teams from experimenting with new code on production. For these reasons, many organizations have shifted their focus towards developing tools and environments that support testing on production. By leveraging tools like canary releases, shadowing traffic, and beta testing, developers can collect sufficient data points to ensure that a release is stable without the need for regression testing. These tools allow for more streamlined and efficient feedback on code changes, enabling engineers to experiment with new code and quickly identify and address any issues that may arise."

Of course, this statement is not true for everyone, but there are more and more smartphone users, and mobile operating systems are very quickly developing an accessible environment. Creating an application and uploading it to the store is also becoming easier. But these apps are often inaccessible to users with disabilities and do not work properly with accessibility settings (such as larger fonts). I'll go through the main problems that users face and tell you how to solve them."

Infrastructure, CI/CD, and basic code snippets all in one. This workshop aimed to familiarize you with the composable approach -- closest to the \"magic button\" as possible.  In this session, we'll walk you through how Terraform conjures infrastructure like magic, shared workflows streamline processes, and Maven archetypes simplify code generation. As the cherry on top -- live demo of the accelerator approach with Google cloud platfrom."
