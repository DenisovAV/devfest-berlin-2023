This hands-on session covers key aspects of data analytics and will empower you with practical skills. 1) Data Gathering: Learn how to collect data from diverse sources such as databases and files. 2) Schema Handling: Discover methods for automatically creating and designing data schemas. 3) Data Manipulation: Dive into Kotlin DataFrames to efficiently clean and transform data. 4) Data Visualization: Master techniques for visualizing data trends and insights effectively with Kandy. 5) Deep Learning Introduction: Get an introduction to using deep learning models for object detection in practical applications with KotlinDL. As an attendee, you can look forward to a highly interactive workshop. You won't be left to figure things out on your own. The workshop facilitator will provide simple skeletons, small tasks, and datasets. These practical resources will enable you to write just a few lines of code to complete various exercises and gain a solid understanding of the concepts being taught. It's a great opportunity to learn by doing and build your confidence in data analytics with Kotlin. Details for preparation is here https://bit.ly/devfest_kotlin_workshop",

        "description": "In the fast-paced world of agile software development, efficiency and speed are key factors to success. Regression testing, while a powerful tool, may not always be the most practical solution in such environments. While this form of testing has traditionally been used to identify defects and issues with software, the process can be slow, expensive, and can impede development teams from experimenting with new code on production. For these reasons, many organizations have shifted their focus towards developing tools and environments that support testing on production. By leveraging tools like canary releases, shadowing traffic, and beta testing, developers can collect sufficient data points to ensure that a release is stable without the need for regression testing. These tools allow for more streamlined and efficient feedback on code changes, enabling engineers to experiment with new code and quickly identify and address any issues that may arise.",

I worked as a single developer, as a team member, team leader, and as a manager who is responsible for the success of the project. Quite often, Frontend work is the final step before the releases. How not to go crazy when you have just 2 weeks before the release, and the design is not yet fully ready? What to do if you have a new technology stack and the team has not already handled it? What if the important developers leave the team before the release? Let’s talk about how to build processes in a team to have a self-managing team with a healthy environment. At some point, each of us realizes that our job is not only moving Jira tickets. :)",
