        "description": "For several years now, that we’ve been trying to find new solutions on how we could develop a single project and run it on all platforms. We’ve been seeing all types of solutions: some are web-based, others require you to learn a new language, and others even may require that you pay a monthly fee to use. It also comes with the drawback that all your UI depends on the framework implementation. So, if there’s a native update you’ll need to wait until someone rewrites the widgets for you to update your app. Kotlin multiplatform gives us a new solution. It focuses on sharing your business logic across all platforms, leaving the UI to be implemented natively. Since it’s Kotlin, you can take full advantage of its language features - concise, safe, etc. Moreover, if you’re coming from android you might already be familiarised with Kotlin and even if you’re an iOS developer you’ll see that it’s quite similar to Swift.\nJoin me on this triathlon and let’s go through Android, iOS, and Web in under 30 minutes."

This competition has led to many of these Android libraries to implement various possible hack/tricks in order to get up and running inside host Android application as quickly as possible. Eventually leading to bad side effects introduced on the host application side.\nIn this session, you will get to learn about the various ways Android Library developers use to init their code inside the host application. You will also get to understand how these mechanisms work, what pitfalls they bring and where are these employed within an existing Android application. Towards the end of this session, the new and shiny Jetpack Startup AndroidX library will be introduced along with information on how to use it and what it brings to the table to solve the startup mess the Android Library ecosystem is in currently.\nBy the end of this session, you will be all set to build Android libraries that scale and have API which doesn't mess up with the startup of your Android application."

My talk is aimed at enthusiastic Go beginners. It introduces threads/processes, briefly mentions deadlocks, explains the major differences between a thread and a Goroutine, goes over channels and demonstrates a working Go pipeline. (Note to you: I can include code snippets or do a live demo for the pipeline portion; there will be code snippets for channels/Goroutines). "

There is always the risk that a breaking change sneaks in by accident.\nWouldn't it be nice to get notified if you're accidentally breaking your users' code? A tool to inspect the binary API of your Kotlin/Java code can help you exactly with that. In this talk, we will see some of those tools and how that simplifies the life of library & SDK developers."
